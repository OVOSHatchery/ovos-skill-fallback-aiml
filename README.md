Give mycroft some sass with aiml responses for queries

## About 
The skill adds a fallback supplying answers using the [Alice chatbot](https://www.chatbots.org/chatbot/a.l.i.c.e/). This adds some fun interactions to mycroft.

Warning, he might become a bit obnoxious...

This is based on the works of [JarbasAI](https://github.com/JarbasAI) with updates from all over the Mycroft community.

## Examples 
* "Do you like ice cream"
* "Do you like dogs"
* "I have a jump rope"
